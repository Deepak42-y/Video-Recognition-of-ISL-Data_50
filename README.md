# Video-Recognition-of-ISL-Data_50
Uses Isl_data_50 , having 50 classes for indian sign language, its the datadet of videos 
then I uses the CNN+LSTM model for the data training and prediction process, currently it will give the accuracy of 70%, but after modifying the architecture of model i.e. using more filters and Layers, will results in increase in accuracy of the model.
Also you can use different Optimizer like ADAM, NADAM, ADAGRAD etc. to check as hit and trial and Increase in accuracy
the Dataset is easily available online, by the name of ISL_DATA-50.
